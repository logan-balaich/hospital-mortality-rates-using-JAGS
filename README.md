# hospital-mortality-rates-using-JAGS
## Analysis using JAGS for infant mortality rates across 12 different hospitals. 

### Background
The goal of this project is to rank 12 different hospitals based upon their infant mortality rates. This analysis uses JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) to run simulations and provide parameter estimates. 

### Files in this repository 
There are two files in this repository, hospmort.dat contains the data for each of the 12 hospitals. For each hospital the number of operations and the number of deaths are recorded. The second file is HospitalMortality.R and is the R script which contains the analysis and JAGS code.
